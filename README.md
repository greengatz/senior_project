# John Patterson's Senior Project, advisor Foaad Khosmood

This is a project where I try to solve the 2048 sliding tile game using various approaches. I will be comparing these different strategies based on some select factors (run-time, consistency, score, etc).

Project notes:
This code was written for python 2.7, and was developed in eclipse using pydev.

Dependencies:
enum (if python 2.7)
numpy
Robert Xiao's CMA-ES implementation: https://www.lri.fr/~hansen/cmaes_inmatlab.html#python
  -this is only required for the heuristic optimizer

notes:
It's been a little while since I last updated this and am not 100% on the dependencies, if something seems missing feel free to send me an email at greengatz@yahoo.com and I'll try to help out.
